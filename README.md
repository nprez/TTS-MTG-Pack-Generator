# TTS-MTG-Pack-Generator
A tool to create draft boosters for Magic: the Gathering.
Give it a set code (ex: M21) or leave it blank to spin the wheel (perfect for Chaos Drafts).

If I haven't manually added a set yet, it will default to 10 commons, 3 uncommons, and 1 rare/mythic rare of that set.

Almost all sets' packs should spawn properly collated and ordered.

Unless a slot is intended to be foil, there should be no duplicate cards in any pack.
